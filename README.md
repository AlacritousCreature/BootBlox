<p id="usage"></p>

## Usage
It is assumed that your project is up and running Bootstrap v5. If not, [Get it here now](https://v5.getbootstrap.com/)
1. Choose a template of your desire
2. Click the `View Code` button
3. Click the `Copy source code` to copy the content
4. Paste it in your project
5. ðŸŽ‰

**Note:** To use the advanced color palette, you need to include the code in `extras/bs_v5_compiled_colors.scss` in your main scss file, 
or just download the `extras/b5_v5_compiled_colors.css` file and link it in your project

## Contribute
- Fork the repo
- Fire up the terminal in its directory
- Type `npm install` and hit enter to install Bootstrap v5 and bootstrap-icons
- Go to a category folder of your choice under `blocks` folder, or if you would like to add a new `block` category, create an issue,  and it will be assigned to you
- Create a new `<block_category_num>.html` file. For eg. the `Blog` already contains 3 templates, so the next one would be `blog_4.html` (You can use the HTML boilerplate provided in `blocks/boilerplate/boilerplate.html`)
- To make components follow the theme colors from the advanced color palette, use class `btn-primary`, `bg-primary`, `text-primary` for buttons, background and text color respectively. The theme will be applied automatically upon choosing by the user
- After you are done creating the template block, create a SVG thumbnail and add it in the `assets/thumbs`, and then make a pull request. We will handle it from there to include it in the main page
